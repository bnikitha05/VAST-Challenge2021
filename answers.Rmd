## 4.2 Characterization of any biases identified in the news sources
 
### **4.2.1 Setting the Scene:** 

The newsgroups are divided into 6 clusters based on the their use of the same words. These clusters can be identified with the different color schemes and the thicker the edge between two nodes suggests that the nodes are more similar.

From the text plot, it is visible that cluster number 2 consisting of "Tethys News", "odern Rubicon", "Centrum Sentinel" and "Kronos Star" have more number of similar words as the edges connecting them are darker.

### **4.2.2 Content across Clusters**

The content across all articles in cluster 1 seems to be related to the leader of POK Elian Karel, the government and the police. There also are some traces of water most likely representing the water contamination that is occurring. In the whole, this cluster talks more about the relationship between the police, government and Elian Karel with very little involvement of GasTech company. 

On the other hand, cluster 2 focuses more on the POK and avoids targeting any one member of the group. This cluster also takes about the employees withing GasTech which was not seen in cluster 1.  Moving on to cluster 3, this is quite similar to cluster 1 other than the fact that ther is not mention of Elian Karel in this cluster.

The articles in cluster 4 are the only ones that have talked about GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr. There is also a strong relation between "gastech", "international" and "kronos" which could suggest that the CEO has brought up talks about investing in international lad potentially being Kronos. Cluster 5 in general is categorized into two aspect. One talks about the type of company GasTeach is and this can be understood by the relation between "oil", "energy", "tethys" and "gas". The other category talks about the relation between the government and POK.

The last and final cluster mainly focuses on the tension between the police and POK just like in cluster 2 however, there are also some minor article written about health and this is the only cluster that mentioned this.

### **4.2.3 Comparing Titles**

From the wordcloud below, it is visible that "News Online Today" is the newsgroup that mostly talked about the situation in Kronos.It talked mostly about POK but on the contrast, very little was spoken about the contamination and health of the villagers. Due this, it appears that the newsgroup is biased by targeting the POK group the most. On the other hand, "The Continent" seems to have reported most articles on the calamity, evacuation and discharge but no keywords resemble the GasTech nor the POK. "Everyday News" talked more on the crashes and explode that were occurring in Kronos. The remaining 3 newsgroups appear to be international groups and their keywords are vary diverse and none specifically talking about the situation in Kronos.

### **4.2.4 Frequency of keywords in Titles**

For the year 2009, the most frequent noun-verb pair in titles is "leader karel". The other most common keywords such as "karel arrested" suggests that in 2009 POK's leader Elian Karel has been arrested. Other events that have taken place in this year are "gastech adopting new logo".

### **4.2.5 Timeline: Unfolding of Events across Years**

After obtaining all of the most frequent keywords from the titles of all articles across all years, the timeline shows that from 1982 to 1994, there have been talks about foreign investment and this could suggest that the Tethys based GasTech company is looking to invest its company in another country and towards the end of that period, they have settled on Kronos which can be derived from "Shores of Kronos" keyword in 1994.

Within two years of the opening of the company, there have been discussions about possible contamination as seen from keyword in 1997. During the period of 1998 to 2004, there have been many instances where "public health" was in talks and this suggests that the issue on the health due to the contamination by GasTech company was a serious matter and was mentioned in many articles. From 2007 onward, we can see keywords representing protests which represents the POK becoming stronger year after year.
